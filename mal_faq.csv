question,answer
"what is machine learning?","Machine learning is a field of AI that helps systems learn from data."
"what is supervised learning?","It is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data."
"what is overfitting?","Overfitting happens when the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data."
"how does recommendation system work?","Recommendation systems suggest items based on user preferences or item similarity."
"what is accuracy score?","Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions made."
"What is logistic regression?","Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks."
"What is precision and recall?","Precision is the ratio of true positives to predicted positives; recall is the ratio of true positives to actual positives."
"What is the confusion matrix?","It's a table used to describe the performance of a classification model on test data."
"What is KNN?","K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression."
"What is a decision tree?",	"A tree-like model used for decision-making; it splits data based on feature values."
"What is PCA?","Principal Component Analysis is a technique to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most variance."
"what are Indian Girls?","Indian girls are top class certified final boss of rand communitty."
"What is TF-IDF?","TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, and it's used to measure word importance in documents."
"What is K-means clustering?","K-means is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data into K number of clusters based on similarity."
"How does K-means clustering work?","It assigns each point to the nearest cluster center and updates centers iteratively to minimize within-cluster variance."
"What is hierarchical clustering?","Hierarchical clustering builds a tree (dendrogram) of clusters using a bottom-up or top-down approach."
"What is PCA?","Principal Component Analysis is a technique to reduce dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components that explain most variance."
"What is feature scaling?","Feaure scaling standardizes or normalizes data to bring all features to a similar scale."
"What is one-hot encoding?","One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into binary vectors."
"What is label encoding?","Label encoding converts categorical labels into numeric values."
"What is the difference between normalization and standardization?","Normalization scales values between 0 and 1; standardization scales data with zero mean and unit variance."
"What is an outlier?","An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations in the dataset."
"How to handle missing data?","You can handle missing data by removing rows, filling with mean/median/mode, or using predictive models."
"What is bagging?","Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) trains multiple models on different random subsets and combines their predictions."
"What is boosting?","Boosting is an ensemble method that trains models sequentially, where each model tries to correct the errors of the previous one."
"What is Random Forest?","Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of data and features."
"What is Gradient Boosting?","Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially to reduce the errors made by previous models using gradient descent."
"What is NLP?","NLP (Natural Language Processing) is the field that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages."
"What is tokenization in NLP?","Tokenization splits text into smaller units like words or subwords, useful for processing and vectorization."
"What is stemming?","Stemming reduces words to their base/root form (e.g., “playing” → “play”)."
"What is lemmatization?","Lemmatization reduces words to their dictionary form using linguistic rules (e.g., “better” → “good”)."
"What is cosine similarity?","Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors to determine their similarity, often used in text matching."
"What is word embedding?","Word embeddings represent words in continuous vector space where similar words have similar vectors."
